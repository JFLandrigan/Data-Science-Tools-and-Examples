# Data Science Examples

This repository contains tools, examples and workflows for performing different types of analyses.

Within a given folder you will find the code to perform the analysis as well as the data that is needed for the example. It should be noted that some of the examples use built in datasets (e.g. the iris dataset in R) and therefore there are not corresponding data files.
